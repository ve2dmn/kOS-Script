# kOS-Script
Collection of Kerbal Space Program kOS scrips

This is a collection of kOS (Kerbal Operating System) script for the game Kerbal Space Program

Each file is kept with a simple name to be easily type in the ingame console. Function definition files can have longer filename, but since the ingame storage space is limited, space is still a premium.
